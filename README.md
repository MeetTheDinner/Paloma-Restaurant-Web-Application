# Paloma-Restaurant-Web-Application
This is a python web application was part of a group project made for the Database &amp; Web Applications class. The restaurant was inspired by Giulia, a classmate based on her family restaurant in Abruzzo. This web application is meant to manage databases and programming in a simplified manner.

PLEASE NOTE: This project REQUIRES installing the Django library for Python. It will not work without it. It is also recommended that you have a prompt like anaconda and a SQL editor if you ever wish to dig through the database. 

For purposes of making admin changes while running the server use the following credentials:
